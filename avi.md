## Images

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
    - This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

### Search  Engine Optomization (SEO)
__Search engine optimization__ (or SEO) - the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
 - At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people
are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right places on your site to increase
the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in
their results.
    - In order to determine who comes first in the search results, search engines do not only look at what
appears on your site
        - They also consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are). 
            For this reason, SEO is often split into two areas:
            1. on-page techniques 
            2. off-page techniques

#### On-Page
Dependend on the text on your page. 
- use keywords so people can find your site easier!

#### Off-Page
Getting other sites to link to you (EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ON-PAGE) 
- Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. (think 'affiliates')
- They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related
to yours. 
- If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than
just click here or your website address) it may be considered
more relevant.
- The words that appear in links to your site should also appear in
the text of the page that the site links to

### On-Page SEO
1. Page title
2. Url/Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page descriptions 

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases
1. Brainstorm
 - List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.
 - ask other people so you can learn all types of terms/words/phrases for your site
2. Organize
- Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.
3. Research
- There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to
consider
4. Compare
- Compare when does your site appear when you search
- The more sites that cover your website, the more competition you have to face to get to the top of the search results
5. Refine
- Pick which keywords you will focus on.
    - These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.
6. Map
- start picking which keywords you will use for each page.

### Analytics: Learning from your visitors
As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

### How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?
The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.

### What Are Your Visitors Looking At?
- Pages - what pages are most looked at
- landing pages - pages that visitors arrive on when visiting your site
- top exit pages - pages visitors look at before they leave
- bounce rate - shows the people who left on the same page they arrived in 
_a high bounce rate shows that the site is not what they were looking for_

__bounce counts as the following:__
- Clicked a link to another site
- Clicked on an advertisement
-  Entered a new URL
-  Used the "back" button
- Closed the browser

### Where Are Your Visitors Coming From?
The traffic sources link on the left hand side allows you to learn where your visitors are coming from.

### Domain Names / Hosting
In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting
- Domain name - web address
- Web hosting - so that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server.

### FTP & Third Party Tools
To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.
