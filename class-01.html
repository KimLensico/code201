# INTRODUCTORY HTML + JAVASCRIPT

## HTML
- elements:  characters that live inside angled
brackets
    - made up of two tags
- ```<body>``` - everything inside the element is
shown inside the main browser window
- ```<head>``` - contains information
about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a ```<title>``` element inside the ```<head>``` element.
- ```<title>``` - The contents of the ```<title>``` element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you
to view multiple pages at the same time)
- id attribute - global attribute. used for any element 

## JAVASCRIPT

### STEPS TO PLAN YOUR CODE
1. DEFINE THE GOAL: define the task you want to achieve. think of this as a puzzle for thE computer to solve.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: Split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. can be represented using a flowchart. then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP: each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands

- vocabulary: words that computers understand
- syntax: How words are put together to create instructions computers can follow

#### WHAT IS A SCRIPT?
- a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- when the script runs, it might only use a subset (a portion) of
all the instructions
- instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
- to approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (flowcharts can help)

---

- objects: physical things in the computer world
- event is the computer's way of signalling that something just happened 

#### WHAT IS A METHOD? 
- typically represent how people/other things interact with an object in the real world.
- are like questions/instructions that:
    - tell you something about that object (using
information stored in its properties)
    - change the value of one or more of that object's properties
@ THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING
- the code for a method can contain lots of
instructions that together represent one task
- you don't always need to know how it achieves its task- you just need to know how to ask the question/how to interpret any answers it gives you.
