### types of markup
- *Structural markup:* the elements that that can be used to describe both headings and paragraphs
- *Semantic markup:* provides extra information; where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something written is a quotation, the meaning of acronyms, etc.

```<br />``` - add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph 

```<hr />``` - create a break between themes

```<strong>``` - bold

```<em>``` - emphesis. italicize 

```<blockquote>``` - used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.     NOTE: should not use this element just to indent a piece of text â€” **USE CSS**.
