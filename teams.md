# What Google Learned About Teams 

on the good teams 
- members spoke in roughly the same proportion 
    - a phenomenon the researchers referred to as â€˜â€˜equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.â€™â€™ 
    - On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; 
    - on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. 
    - But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 
    - â€˜â€˜As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,â€™â€™ Woolley said. â€˜â€˜**But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.**â€™â€™
- â€˜â€˜average social sensitivityâ€™â€™ 
    - a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on:
        - their tone of voice
        - their expressions 
        - and other nonverbal cues. 

â€˜â€˜shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.â€™â€™ **Psychological** safety is â€˜â€˜a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,â€™â€™ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. 
- â€˜â€˜It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.â€™â€™

What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that:
- no one wants to put on a â€˜â€˜work faceâ€™â€™ when they get to the office. 
- No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. 
- But to be fully present at work, to feel â€˜â€˜psychologically safe,â€™â€™ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. 
    - We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. 
- We canâ€™t be focused just on efficiency. 
    - when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. 
    
    **We want to know that work is more than just labor.**
